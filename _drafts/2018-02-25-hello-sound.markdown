Actually, the title should be "Hello, Jekyll" (～￣▽￣)～

I've written several blogs on Renren, BlogBus, Wordpress, etc.. till I finally decided to wheel myself into to road of application development, entirely. I resigned the work in the planning office, registered myself into the first semester of Bachelor of electronics (like 12 years ago!!) and several online-courses and competitions, took a bunch of exams as "Grundlagen-und-Orientierungs-Prüfung", and have been waiting for the last large surgery on my "lame" leg. And in prevention of getting bored (once more!!) in the German village, this idea has come finally into my mind: OK, it's time to say:

```
Hello Sound
```

to everyone o(*￣▽￣*)ブ!!
