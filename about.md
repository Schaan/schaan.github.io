A hacker. A music lover. A world citizen. A life-long loading Mahayana.

Here is the main logbook of Schaan hosted by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on Github. Schaan commits himself to learning development techniques in the direction of augmented audible environments, including web audio interfaces, digital music, sound processing, speech detection and all other approaches for making the audible world better. Except for learning logs he also documents most of his crazy ideas and events in life to share with you. Maybe he will be writing fully in stream of consciousness but yes I think you can still find some links to his works, if you only want to see some source codes.

Have fun here, and may the Ears be with you.

### Multilingual Support
Thanks for the cool instructions from [Sylvain Durand](https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/) I've added a language switch in the navigation bar (If you are viewing this site on mobile just click the hamburger nav icon :D). I will be writing blogs concurrently in English, Chinese and German. Please notice that those monolingual versions of index can contain different articles. If you cannot find a multilingual option in the navigation bar, it means that the page or post you are reading is only written in a specific language without translations.
