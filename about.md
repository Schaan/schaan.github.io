A hacker. A music lover. A world citizen. A life-long loading Mahayana.

Here is the main logbook of Schaan which is hosted by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on Github. Schaan is committing himself for learning development techniques in direction of augmented audible environments, including web audio interfaces, digital music and all other approaches for making the audible world better. Except for the learning logs he also tries to document most of his crazy ideas and events in the life, which can be shared with you. Maybe he is writing fully in stream of consciousness but yes I think you can still find some links to his works, if you only want to see some source codes.

Have fun here, and may the Ears be with you.
