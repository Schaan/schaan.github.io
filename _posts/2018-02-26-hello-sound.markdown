(Actually, the title could be "Hello, Jekyll" (～￣▽￣)～)

I've written several blogs on Renren, BlogBus, Wordpress, etc.. till I finally decided to wheel myself into the road of application development, entirely. I resigned the work in the planning office, registered myself into the first semester of Bachelor (like 12 years ago!!) of electronics and several online-courses and competitions, have struggled in a bunch of exams as "Grundlagen-und-Orientierungs-Prüfungen", and been waiting for the last major surgery on my "lame" leg. And in prevention of getting bored (once more!!) in the German village, this idea has come finally into my mind: OK, it's time to say:

> Hello Sound

to everyone o(*￣▽￣*)ブ!! Shout it out loudly as somebody like you can really hear that, maybe begin to listen to it from now on.

The main idea is to construct a home for my wandering thoughts all related to the aural world — a piece of world that is so significant to me in the past 10-15 years. The motivation comes recently from this TED-video. Here the speaker insists that **"we are losing our listening"** and sends us the appeal to give more concerning to this topic and contribute a little to help establish an educational system for listening:

Sure, I'd like to give some outputs and open a channel for mutual communications for technical and knowledge parts. This is set to be a logbook for my self-schooling that contains following series:
+ Skills in programming and development, especially around web tech and audio processing;
+ Further knowledge based on my background in room acoustics, any maybe more, like theory of music and musical acoustics;
+ Some related inspirations and philosophy got from my everyday-life, reading and surfing;
+ Music I'm listening to and playing with

It can also be something more. A year ago I was still fighting with the proposals of a PhD program and a research project. After throwing a lot of papers into trash can I was asked by the professor -- "Which topics will you have in your heart, personally?" I've searched for the answer deep in myself for a long time. OK it could definitely not be something with building industry and computer-aided architectural design. (And that's why I quit from the program. ╮(╯-╰)╭) I realized that the most parts of my life and the network of friendships are weaved by a general thread together -- it's the sound, the time with vibrations and ears -- It is the right 組紐(Kumihimo) for me and the little world in my heart.

It can also be a Kumihimo which connects you and me. I've read it somewhere I could not find anymore (if you found the refs just tell me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apiSchaan)):

> Sound is that you can use to feel the time.

I'm trying to get into the essence of this sentence and standing now at the beginning, with you, here.
